## The CLI

The CLI, or Command Line Interface, is the tool you will use to interact with Cloud Foundry. The CLI runs in a terminal window and makes REST calls to the Cloud Foundry API. The CLI has been preinstalled in the terminal window. 

You can verify this by checking the version:

`cf version`{{execute}}
